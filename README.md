## Projects:
**[Remote Access Attacks Report:](https://github.com/kyleashburn/remote_access_attacks)**
In this project, I analyzed Windows log files from my desktop looking at attempts to use the remote desktop protocol to log into my computer. I started with an 8gb log file that wasn't formatted in a useful way and transformed it into a roughly 800 mb json that I then used for my analysis. I focused on questions about where the attacks were coming from and the like. Mostly just a data analytics project.

**[Database Design Project:](https://github.com/kyleashburn/Database-Project---Sinclair)**
In this project I completed as a final project for a database class at my community college, I constructed an Oracle database that was focused on being the backend of a hypothetical website meant to aid in the job search process/process of filling jobs. I built the entire database up from scratch and included triggers, views, and stored procedures. It is filled with dummy data but I still ran some queries on it to illustrate the functionality of the design.
