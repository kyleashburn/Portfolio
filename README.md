**[Remote Access Attacks Report:](https://github.com/kyleashburn/remote_access_attacks)**
In this project, I analyzed Windows log files from my desktop looking at attempts to use the remote desktop protocol to log into my computer. I started with an 8gb log file that wasn't formatted in a useful way and transformed it into a roughly 800 mb json that I then used for my analysis. I focused on questions about where the attacks were coming from and the like. Mostly just a data analytics project.
